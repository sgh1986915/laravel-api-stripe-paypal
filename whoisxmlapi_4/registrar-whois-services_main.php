<h1>Whois Hosting</h1> 
<p class="rightTxt1">
	Do you find your in-house whois service ticklish, prompting your clients to turn their back on you? Do you struggle to obtain whois data consistently? Each registrar has its own set of whois data, which only increases the complexity of deriving the data. 

	Our whois parsing system is a utility that collects extensive information about any given domain by using API that sends a series of DNS and WHOIS queries. The report is generated in raw as well as parsed format. It would include information about the data center hosting the web server, mail server, and domain name server (DNS) of the specified domain; domain owner, domain registrar that registered the domain, the created/changed/expire date of the domain, list of all DNS records, and more relevant information.
